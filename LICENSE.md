All possible extensions are shipped in the License's text, but they shall apply only if specified by The maintainer(s). Extensions are not part of the License's numerical order (Section 1, Section 2, and so); instead they are found at the end, preceeded by a heading with their specific identifier, and then using "A, B, C..." notation rather than "1, 2, 3..." notation for each section.

Every piece of software shall specify the License they are licensed under via a text block, an SPDX identifier, or such. Version 1.1 of the Vuelto License shall be identified by the "VLv1.1" code, and, optionally, a text block indicating it's the Version 1.1 of the Vuelto License.

### **6.2. Possible extensions**

The following extensions, with their content available at the end of this License as outlined in **Section 6**, are available to the Vuelto License, and must be identified using the specified Identifier that follows their name.
