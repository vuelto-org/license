- The project repository has been archived or set to read-only.
- The project has been officially pronounced as "dead", "unmaintained", or something else with the same meaning by The maintainer(s).

```

4. Interpretation

The decision on whether The software is unmaintained will be made by the original maintainer(s) or the designated project governance body, if any. In the absence of such a body, the community of contributors may reach a consensus according to the project's documented processes.

5. Communication of License change

If The software is declared unmaintained by The maintainer(s), the change shall be communicated by an update to The project's "README file", website, or any other mean of communication that makes this change clear.

6. Extensibility of the License

It is possible for The maintainer(s) to extend the Vuelto License with additional terms. These must be made clear by The maintainer(s) by specifying them when using the License's identifier.

All possible extensions are shipped in the License's text, but they shall apply only if specified by The maintainer(s). Extensions are not part of the License's numerical order (Section 1, Section 2, and so); instead they are found at the end, preceded by a heading with their specific identifier, and then using "A, B, C..." notation rather than "1, 2, 3..." notation for each section.

6.1. License identification

Every piece of software shall specify the License they are licensed under via a text block, an SPDX identifier, or such. Version 1.1 of the Vuelto License shall be identified by the "VLv1.1" code, and, optionally, a text block indicating it's the Version 1.1 of the Vuelto License.

6.2. Possible extensions

The following extensions, with their content available at the end of this License as outlined in Section 6, are available to the Vuelto License, and must be identified using the specified Identifier that follows their name.

- VL-C (Vuelto License-Copyright). Identifier: "VL-Cv1.1".
